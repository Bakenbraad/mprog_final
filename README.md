#### Problem
The biggest problem for many people that collect vinyl records is that they have many records that they want and can't find. Yet they also have double records that they obviously don't need. The solution is buying and selling in a likeminded community! However when you search for vinyl on sites like marktplaats.nl (A large dutch public market place site) you only find a couple of offers and many are shops that are advertising. The alternative would be discogs.com, a site that allows users to trade music related goods (primarily records), however the app they provide is very user unfriendly and basicly shows the website in app form.

My app is going to create a user friendly vinyl collection, trade and market experience, with last.fm's api to request record data and present it in a clean format. Users can buy, sell and (optionally) swap records through instinctive interfaces. User data, a wantlist and a collection list, will be kept in firebase.

The login screen should be simple with options to log in and/or create an account.
The main menu will be more interesting with a clean 5 button interface, a buy, sell, profile and settings button presented in a window and below a logout button to return to the login activity.
