# Vinyl Countdown
Â© 2017 Rens van der Veldt ALL RIGHTS RESERVED
#### Problem
The biggest problem for many people that collect vinyl records is that they have many records that they want and can't find. Yet they also have double records that they obviously don't 
need. The solution is buying and selling in a likeminded community! However when you search for vinyl on sites like marktplaats.nl (A large dutch public market place site) you only find 
a couple of offers and many are shops that are advertising. The alternative would be discogs.com, a site that allows users to trade music related goods (primarily records), however the 
app they provide is very user unfriendly and basicly shows the website in app form.

My app is going to create a user friendly vinyl collection, trade and market experience, with last.fm's api to request record data and present it in a clean format. Users can buy, sell 
and swap records through instinctive interfaces. User data, a wishlist and a collection list, will be kept in firebase.

#### Solution

The vinyl countdown solves the problem posed. It offers a simple yet instinctive app that allows all functions described above plus a safe messaging service. 
Users can buy and sell records the data of which is retrieved by the LASTfm Api. They can add records to wishlist and collection. Users can also make deals with other users and thus remove sales from the database.
