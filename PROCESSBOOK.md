##Week 1
### Monday
Wrote proposal, created basic design for main activities. Description of basic flow of activities and code design. Can be found in README.md.
### Tuesday
Wrote design in detail. This is found in DESIGN.md, the MVP is specified here, all activities managers and classes are explained thouroughly.
The file is accompanied by a flow diagram to get a picture of the activities and how to navigate between them. Another diagram
shows how different sections influence each other and how managers maintain the data in each section. 
### Wednesday
The proposal should be edited slightly to match developments as a result of the design stage. Some extra activities are needed for the app
but won't affect the overall functionality, merely optimize it. The project is created and added to github and firebase.
The classes for users and records are created and firebase is implemented in the gradle files as well as the google-services file.
